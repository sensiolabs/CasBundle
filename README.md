Adds the CAS authentication to Symfony 2
========================================

Read about it on its [official documentation](https://github.com/sensio/CasBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.rst).

-  [More information about CAS (Central Authentication Service)](http://www.jasig.org/cas).
-  Unlike [SimpleCasBundle](https://github.com/jmikola/SimpleCASBundle), it's based on the Symfony2 security component.
-  Proxy features are not yet available.
